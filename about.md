I am a researcher in foundation of mathematics and theoretical computer science. My research interests include categorical logic, homotopy type theory, topos theory, and higher category theory. In addition to these, I am fond of remote places in nature, museums, hiking, and photography. Moreover, I am a reader of philosophy and history of philosophical traditions and enjoy discussing them with everybody. In particular, among classics, I read Plato, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and among contemporaries Wittgenstein, Searle, Foucault, and Badiou are closer to my taste.
