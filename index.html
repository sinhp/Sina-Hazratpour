	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sina!</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my website. You can get to know me better <a href="/about">here. </a></p>
	<p> I put up my maths notes  <a href="https://sinhp.github.io/Mathematical-scribblings"> here</a>. By profession, I will write 
	 more about the stuff related to category theory, logic, and topology. Your comments, corrections, questions, and suggestions  
		(via gitcommit, comments, emails, etc.) are absolutely welcome.  
            <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> <i class="em em-relaxed"> <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
	</p>
		
        <p> Ocassionally, I will write some of my thoughts on range of issues of philosphical nature in 
           <a href="/phil-blog">Philsophical contemplation </a> page.
           If you want to discuss those ideas further, I would appreciate if you leave your comments under the posts.
