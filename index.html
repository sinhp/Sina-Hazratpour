	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sina!</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my website. You can read more about me <a href="/about">here. </a></p>
        <p>From time to time, I write some of my thoughts on wide range of issues of philosphical nature in 
           <a href="/phil-blog">Philsophical contemplation </a> page.
           If you want to discuss those ideas further, I would appreciate if you leave your comments under the posts. &#U+1F60A </p>
