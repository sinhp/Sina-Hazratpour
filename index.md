<h2>Hi there, I'm Sina!</h2>
<p> Welcome to my website. You can get to know me better <a href="/about">here. </a></p>
<p> I put up my maths notes  <a href="https://sinhp.github.io/Mathematical-scribblings"> here</a>. By profession, I will write more about the stuff related to category theory, logic, and topology. Your comments, corrections, questions, and suggestions (via 
gitcommit, comments, emails, etc.) are absolutely welcome.  </p>
		
<p> Ocassionally, I will write some of my thoughts on range of issues of philosphical nature in <a href="/phil-blog">Philsophical contemplation </a> page. If you want to discuss those ideas further, I would appreciate if you leave your comments under the posts. </p>
