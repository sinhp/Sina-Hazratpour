## About Me 

<p align="justify" style="max-width:600px">
I am a researcher in foundation of mathematics and theoretical computer science. My main research interests include categorical logic, type theory, topos theory, and higher category theory. My advisor is <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/">Prof. Steve Vickers</a> a member of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/">Theory of Computation</a> group at University of Birmingham. You can find more about my <a href="/Research">research work</a>.

### Other interests 
<p align="justify" style="max-width:600px">
I am fond of remote places in nature, museums, hiking, and photography. Moreover, I am a reader of philosophy and history of philosophical thoughts and enjoy discussing them any opportunity I find. In particular, among classics, I read Plato, Voltaire, Kant, Hegel, and among contemporaries Wittgenstein, Searle, Foucault, and Badiou are closer to my taste. I used to find more free time during my undergraduate and masters years to read these folks but during my PhD years I do regret that I do not have enough time to commit myself more seriously to reading some of heftier books. Ocassionally, I will write some of my thoughts on range of issues of philosphical nature in <a href="/peripatetic-thoughts">Philsophical contemplation</a> page. If you like to discuss those ideas further, I would appreciate if you leave your comments under the posts.
