# Building your own website with **Jekyll Now**

This website is hosted on **Github** and it is created by [**Jekyll Now**](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) , a more user-friendly version of [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) perfect for building minimal and static, yet beautiful and secure websites. A really quick and easy-to-follow guide is provided [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). For a quick start, you can also find the source code for setting up your own website at [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).  

Make sure you check this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as well. Personally, I found it very useful and succinct. 


## Why Github at all?
