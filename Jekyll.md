title: Building your own website with Jekyll Now
permalink: /Jekyll/
---



This website is hosted on **GitHub** and it is created by [**Jekyll Now**](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) , a more user-friendly version of [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) and perfect for building minimal and static, yet beautiful, secure, and stable websites. A really quick and easy-to-follow guide is provided [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). For a quick start, you can also find the source code for setting up your own website at [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).  

Make sure you check this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as well. Personally, I found it very useful and succinct. 


## Why Jekyll at all? 

You can do so much with Jekyll. Some of the best web developers use it for building their own websites. Here is a good examples:
[CSS Wizardy](https://csswizardry.com/about/).

But if you are, like me, an academic and want to publish your website with the help of Jekyll as fast as possible and not necessarily concerned about how fancy your website should look like, you may be interested in reading
[Github for academics](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/06/04/github-for-academics/).

Also, a really cool maths blog on discrete geometry, graph theory, and other stuff built by Jekyll: [11011110](https://11011110.github.io/blog/)

### How to write maths with Jekyll? 

**MathJax** is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers.

[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) comes with optional support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via MathJax within math blocks. This [blogpost](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) has a good tutorial on how to use MathJax with Jekyll. Also, you will probably find the official [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) website useful.
