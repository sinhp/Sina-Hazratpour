# Two concepts of liberty 

I recently read Isaiah Berlin's famous essay *two concepts of liberty* [two concepts of liberty] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Concepts_of_Liberty) in which he delineates between two different version of historical understanding of the notion of liberty by western societies; the _positive_ and _negative_ liberty. In this article I will try to first share my understanding of this essay and emphasise the importance of havinf this distiction in mind in our political discourse. Finally I want to hint at insufficiency of this dichotomy to characterize the notion of liberty in the realms of participation in political projects and also relationships.
