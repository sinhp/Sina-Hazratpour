# Two concepts of liberty 

I recently read Isaiah Berlin's famous essay *two concepts of liberty*  
[two concepts of liberty][1] in which he delineates between two different version of historical understanding of the notion of liberty by western societies; the __positive__ and __negative__ liberty. In this article I will try to first share my understanding of this essay and emphasise the importance and usefulness of having this distinction in mind for our political discourse. Finally, I want to hint at insufficiency of this dichotomy in characterizing the notion of liberty in the realms of participation in political projects and also of relationships.
