# The famous essay

I recently read Isaiah Berlin's famous essay [two concepts of liberty][1] in which he delineates between two different versions of historical understanding of the notion of liberty by western societies; the __negative__  and __positive__ liberty. The idea of negative nad positive liberty is not due to Berlin hismself and goes back at least to Kant. ([negative and positive liberty][2]) In this post I will try to first share my understanding of this essay and emphasise the importance and usefulness of having this distinction in mind for our political discourse. Finally, I want to hint at insufficiency of this dichotomy in characterizing the notion of liberty in the realms of participation in shared political projects and also in relationships and love.

## Two sorts of liberty

> But if we are not armed with an _a priori_ guarantee of the proposition that a total harmony o true values is somewhere to be found- perhaps in some ideal realm the characteristics which we can, in our finite state, not so much as conceive- we must fall back on the ordinary resources of empirical observation and ordinary human knowledge. And these certainly give us no warrant for supporting (or even understanding what would be meant by saying) that all good things, or all bad things for that matter, are reconcilable with each other. The world that we encounter in ordinary experience is one in which we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate, and claims equally absolute, the realization of some of which must inevitably involve the sacrifice of others. Indeed, it is because this is their situation that men place such immense values upon the freedom to choose.
