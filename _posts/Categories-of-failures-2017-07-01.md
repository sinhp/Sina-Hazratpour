Why are there so many poor nations in the world? Is really economic success and prosperity such a big mystery? Is it too much to ask for a country like Sierra Leone to have electricity, some roads, or if they had some basic infrastructures, such as schools with roofs and teachers? Why can't this society benefit from electricity technology some thing every one knows how to do! The country has an extremely low life expectancy at 57.8 years. Can we blame all of this on their geography, culture, history, or economic ignorance of their leaders? Is their such a thing as fate of a nation, or historical inevitability?  


The main thesis the book puts forward is that a nation's economic fate, if there is such a notion as fate at all, is determined not by geography, culture, or shortcomings of individual policy designers, rather fundamentally is a matter of developement of inclusive political institution which promote rule of law, openness of society, and willingness to permit creative destruction.

The book is highly praised by notable economists and political scientists including Kenneth Arrow, Peter Diamond, Francis Fukuyama, Dani Rodrik, Robert Solow, and others. Among many praise and admirations, I think, the way Dani Rodrik, of Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, reviews the book is closest to heart of essence of the book: 

> It’s the politics, stupid! That is Acemoglu and Robinson’s simple yet compelling explanation for why so many countries fail to develop. From the absolutism of the Stuarts to the antebellum South, from Sierra Leone to Colombia, this magisterial work shows how powerful elites rig the rules to benefit themselves at the expense of the many.  Charting a careful course between the pessimists and optimists, the authors demonstrate history and geography need not be destiny. But they also document how sensible economic ideas and policies often achieve little in the absence of fundamental political change. 
 



But as Acemoglu and Robinson argued China is not a lone example and not a reliable model compared to sustainable prosperity of full inclusive societies.
