Iran Rouhani vs Supreme Leader 
China ban on imagination 

The difference between the two 
electoral democracy 
capitalist economy 
liberal democracy


It is as vital for institutionalize liberal thinking to read Voltaire's Candide  as it is Mill's On liberty or for that matter Isiah Berlin's four essays on liberty.  


six functions of language related to democratic thinking: 

1. Language is designative
2.  Language is adumbrative
3.  Language is fanciful.  fanciful funciton ---> accidental psycho-logical associations
4.  Language is syntactical. The scope and power of a language to designate, to adum-
 brate, and to awaken an intuitive awareness of the qualities pertaining to
 the fulness of all that is represented depend upon the ways in which the
 signs are combined quite as much as upon the diversity of signs that are
 available. The syntactical structure of a language adapted to fulfil these
 functions can be indefinitely improved. Literary artists are creative in
 this field.

5.  Language is activative. 
 Since democracy rests upon persuasion
 leading to action, it is obviously important that a language be fully ac-
 tivative. This function may be diminished or magnified according to the
 way in which language is used and the associations formed in learning it.
 This activative function, however, should be kept in close and proper cor-
 relation with the designative, adumbrative, and intuitive. Democracy
 has been said to be ruled by talk. But so also is a dictatorship. The dif-
 ference is that in a dictatorship the activative function of language as used
 by the dictator loses connection with its true designative and adumbra-
 tive functions. It moves the people to action without informing them of
 the realities involved in their action.: This is the difference between per-
 nicious propaganda and that kind of propaganda which is necessarily
 involved in all social control
