I was introduced to Ralf Dahrendorf in a paper entitled [The Politics of Public Debt][1] by [Wolfgang Streeck][2], a prominent contemporary 
German economic sociologist. In that paper, he cites Dahrendorf's essay [Vom Sparkapitalismus zum Pumpkapitalismus][3] whereby he credits 
him for coining the term "Pumpkapitalismus". Here is the pertinent excerpt: 

> Over time, insufficient growth gave rise to a sequence of different crisis configurations,
with (i) high inflation and low debt in the 1970s followed, from 1980 to 1993, by (ii) low
inflation and public and private debt rising simultaneously, and from 1994 to 2007 by
(iii) low inflation, receding public debt, and further increasing private debt. Since 2008,
we continue to see (iv) low inflation, now combined with slightly declining private debt
and exploding public debt ... Overall, growing
public debt was part of a general rise of indebtedness in capitalist countries, which
coincided with low growth and indeed may have been the result of attempts to sustain 
and restore economic performance (“Pumpkapitalismus”15). 

So, I searched his name on Google and ended up watching one interview of him from the series _Conversations with History_ 
(video series on international affairs) hosted by UC Berkeley's Harry Kreisler recorded on April 4, 1989. His eloquence and breadth 
of knowledge are remarkable in this interview.

Ralf Gustav Dahrendorf was born in Hamburg on May 1 1929. In the summer of 1939 , His father, a former Social Democrat deputy in the Reichstag, like many other SDP MPs, was arrested by the Nazis when they came to power. He was educated at the Heinrich-Hertz Oberschule, 
and was sent to a concentration camp at age fifteen, accused of anti-Nazi activities. According to the interview he luckily survived,
and after the war enrolled at Hamburg University, where he read Classics and Philosophy. He became a doctor of philosophy and classics (PhD) in 1952, and after that he decided to go to London, to study sociology at LSE. 

He is highly achieved both in scholarly world, and in the world of politics, and public service. His achievements in the latter include: member of the German Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary of State at the Foreign Office of Germany, European Commissioner for External Relations and Trade, European Commissioner for Research, Science and Education and Member of the British House of Lords. 


In the world of academia, he was director of the London School of Economics for a decade, then the chairman of the social sciences department at Konstanz University until 1987 when he accepted the position of warden of St. Antony’s College, Oxford. He was also a Research Professor at the Berlin Social Science Research Center. His mentor at LSE was Karl Popper and Kant, Weber, and Marx are certainly great influences on his intellectual formation. 


My goal in this essay is to highlight one crucial point he makes in the interview: The difference between
